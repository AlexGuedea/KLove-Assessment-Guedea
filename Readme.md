footprints.....

While on spending the weekend in Roseville with my son, we decided it's really time to move back to Roseville from Hillsboro Oregon, and the fun ensued....

I've spent more time doing backend work but sometimes I get called to help out with UI kind of stuff.

Usage:
	You will need to load the code with VS 2019 or publish to an IIS Server
	You will either need to build the database by hand or execute the migration provided in the solution

	I created 2 pages - Search and Favorits
	The search page has 2 controls a date picker and a text box to enter the number of verses to fetch - date and number ranges apply

	As the verses are displayed, the user can click to add the verse to their favorites.
	As the user browses through their favorites, they can click to remove them.

Stack:
Asp Net Core
Entity Framework Core
Bootstrap 4
Sql Server 2019

Nothing fancy i always say - unless requirements specifically call for it.
